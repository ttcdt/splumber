Space Plumber Release Notes
===========================

1.10
----

This release is the first (and presumably last) from the TTCDT Dev Team.
Don't expect any change from now.

The only change is that MS Windows binaries are now 64 bit by default.
We also got rid of that release-candidate nonsense [Tiny @ ttcdt]

1.1.0-rc4
---------

 - License change: released into the public domain.
 - New features: includes support for QDGDF 0.96 new feature
   'embedded tar'. So, the `splumber' executable includes
   all the necessary data (images, textures, sounds, maps, etc.).

1.1.0-rc3
---------

 - New command line argument `3', to run in 3x scale mode.

1.1.0-rc2
---------

 - This release includes some bugfixes and compatibility issues
   with older systems.

1.1.0-rc1
---------

 - Space Plumber has been ported to use the QDGDF library, so it's
   compilable in a bigger variety of platforms and has some new features
   (the most important is sound support under Linux). The game itself
   is exactly the same.
